# NeurIPS LLM Efficiency Challenge

Basically, I am trying to use the llama_recipes for submission, and using `trl SFTTrainer` for training.
I am currently running the training with Google Colab with the notebooks in [notebooks](./notebooks) folder.

## Training Methodology

- Using SFTTrainer from trl
    - Supervised Fine Tuning
    - Use Dolly-5K template as instruction template
- Adapt [NEFT](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/issues/870) to enhance robustness
